Calculate two different breakevens, up and down

Price is measured strictly as ratio of amount1/amount2 (or newAmount1 / newAmount2). Your reported price when disputing we call P0 (this comes from the chosen newAmount2 in the UI)

For price goes up, this means tokenToSwap is token1.

Next, calculate immediate profit in token2 terms:

	immediate_profit_2 - loss(R) = 0 

loss(R) is in token2 terms. We call the price you get disputed at P1 (P0*(1+R))
swapFee is in token1 terms and is converted.

	loss(R) = newAmount1 * R / P1 - (swapFee/(P0*(1+R))

For immediate_profit_2, we simply look at the new price we are implying (P0) 
Next, we do:

	Distance = oldAmount1 / P0 - oldAmount2. 

	immediate_profit2 = Distance - fees

	where fees are:

	if tokenToSwap is token2: swapFees + burnFees
	if tokenToSwap is token1: (swapFees + burnFees) / P0


-----------------------

For price goes down, this means tokenToSwap is token2.

Next, calculate immediate profit in token1 terms:

	immediate_profit_1 - loss(R)_1 = 0 

loss(R) is in token1 terms. We call the price you get disputed at P1 (P0/(1+R))
swapFee is in token2 terms and is converted.

	loss(R)_1 = newAmount2 * R * P1 - (swapFee * P1)

For immediate_profit_1, we simply look at the new price we are implying (P0) 
Next, we do:

	Distance = oldAmount1 - oldAmount2 * P0. 

	immediate_profit1 = Distance - fees

	where fees are:

	if tokenToSwap is token2: (swapFees + burnFees) * P0
	if tokenToSwap is token1: (swapFees + burnFees) 

-------

this is all probably wrong. it seems like if we keep a consistent numeraire treatment the breakeven barriers are ~ (b+f)/(1+f) where b is immediate profit / dispute notional and f is swap fee
